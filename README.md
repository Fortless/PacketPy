# PacketPy
PacketPy is an open-source solution for stress testing network devices using different testing methods.
Currently, there are only three methods availible, both in the same category (ICMP):
  -ICMP (Randomized Byte Size)
  -ICMP (Linear Byte Size) (32-65500 cycle)
  -ICMP (Fixed Byte Size)
  
  I will be adding more features soon!
